## Authentication redirect configuration

Google sign-in, password reset links, and account confirmation emails all return
the browser to a URL that Supabase Auth must have allow-listed. When the
requested URL is not allow-listed, Supabase Auth silently substitutes its
project Site URL, which is the default `http://localhost:3000` for a fresh
project. That is why an unconfigured project sends the deployed prototype back
to localhost after Google sign-in.

In the Supabase dashboard, under **Authentication → URL Configuration**:

- **Site URL**: the deployed prototype origin, for example `https://scholarpath-addu.vercel.app`
- **Redirect URLs**: the deployed origin with a wildcard path (`https://scholarpath-addu.vercel.app/**`), a scoped wildcard for preview deployments such as `https://scholarpath-addu*.vercel.app/**`, and the local development origins `http://localhost:5173/**` and `http://127.0.0.1:5173/**`

Under **Authentication → Providers → Google**, the Google Cloud OAuth client must
list `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` as an authorized
redirect URI.

Optional: set `VITE_SITE_URL` in the deployed environment (see `.env.example`)
to make every build return to one canonical origin. Leave it unset locally so
local development signs in against `http://localhost:5173`.

## Email notifications (Resend)

Deadline reminders and application status updates are emailed through
[Resend](https://resend.com). Three Supabase Edge Functions handle delivery:

| Function | Trigger | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `process-deadline-reminders` | Scheduled (pg_cron + pg_net) | Emails the 7-day / 3-day / 1-day reminders for scholarships, open applications, and saved calendar deadlines |
| `notify-application-status` | Called by the app after a status change | Emails the applicant when staff (or the applicant) moves an application |
| `send-test-email` | Settings -> Email delivery test | Sends one message to the signed-in user so delivery is verifiable without waiting for a schedule |

### Setup

1. **Verify the sending domain in Resend.** Until its DNS records report as
   verified, Resend rejects mail from that address. The only sender that works
   without a verified domain is `onboarding@resend.dev`, which delivers solely
   to the Resend account owner's own inbox.
2. **Set the Edge Function secrets.** These are server-side only and must never
   carry a `VITE_` prefix, which would inline them into the browser bundle:

   ```sh
   supabase secrets set \
     RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxx \
     RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=alerts@yourdomain \
     RESEND_FROM_NAME="ScholarPath AdDU" \
     APP_SITE_URL=https://scholarpath-addu.vercel.app/ \
     REMINDER_CRON_SECRET=<a long random value>
   ```

3. **Deploy the functions:**

   ```sh
   supabase functions deploy process-deadline-reminders --no-verify-jwt --use-api
   supabase functions deploy notify-application-status
   supabase functions deploy send-test-email
   ```

   Two deliberate choices here:

   - `--no-verify-jwt` on the reminder function, because the platform-level JWT
     check rejects the service role key and the scheduled caller presents a
     shared secret instead. The function compares that secret by exact value and
     fails closed when `REMINDER_CRON_SECRET` is unset. Never point this endpoint
     at the anon key: it is public, and this function can email every student.
   - `--use-api` only if you do not have Docker running; the CLI needs Docker to
     bundle functions locally otherwise.

4. **Schedule the daily run** (optional). Uncomment the `pg_cron` block at the
   bottom of `supabase/schema.sql`, replace the project ref, store the same
   `REMINDER_CRON_SECRET` value with
   `alter database postgres set app.settings.reminder_cron_secret = '...'`, and
   apply it. The job runs at 07:00 Asia/Manila.

### Verifying delivery

Open **Settings -> Email delivery test** and press *Send test email*. It sends
one message to the signed-in user's own address and reports the real outcome, so
delivery can be confirmed without waiting for a scheduled reminder. Every
scheduled send is also recorded in `notification_email_log` with the Resend
message id and status.

### How delivery preferences are honored

The notification center settings live in localStorage, so they are mirrored to
`profiles.notification_preferences` whenever they change. The reminder function
skips the in-app row when `inAppEnabled` is false, and skips the email when
`emailEnabled` is false or the relevant reminder timing is switched off. Every
delivery is recorded in `notification_email_log`, keyed by a stable per-user
source key, so a reminder is never sent twice.

### Deploying so reminders actually email

Email reminders are computed server-side from the `custom_deadlines` table, so a
reminder must exist in Supabase before it can ever be emailed. The Calendar
saves to Supabase only when the app holds a live Supabase session, which means a
build running in demo mode saves reminders to localStorage only.

Set `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (or
`VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) in the hosting environment as well as locally.
Otherwise the deployed site silently falls back to demo mode and its calendar
reminders never reach the reminder function.

The Calendar now reports the outcome each time a reminder is added or removed,
and any reminder that exists only in a browser is pushed to Supabase on the next
successful sign-in.
